<p>
<b>"For all I know"</b> is often used in situations where the statement that you are
 qualifying with this phrase runs completely contrary to what was said right
 before that, or is a wild guess that would change everything compared to what
 was said before.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
I don't know why his opinion of these products is so favorable. He could be an
investor in the company that produces them, <b>for all I know</b>.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
<b>"As far as I know"</b> is not used alongside guesses. It means that you are
 offering information that is based on what you actually know, but you don't
 know a lot, or you could be mistaken.

<p>
<b>For all I know.</b> Peopel typically say this when they think they know very
little or nothing about a subject. (They have no expertise at all). (Theo như
tao biết&#x2026;)
<b>As far as I know</b>. People typically say this when they know at least a little
bit about something and may even be true experts in the field, but are
granting that no one ever knows everything. (Theo như những gì tao học
thì/theo kiến thức của tao thì &#x2026;)
