                           Memory Addressing

Abstract

   The memory of a computer system consists of tiny electronics
   switches, with each switch in one of two states: open or closed.  It
   is, however, more convenient to think of these states as 0 and 1,
   rather than open and closed.  Thus, each switch can represent a bit.
   The memory unit consists of millions of such bits.  In order to make
   memory more manageable, eight bits are grouped into a byte.  Memory
   can then be viewed as consisting of an ordered sequence of bytes.
   Each byte in this memory is identified by its sequence number
   starting with 0.

1.  Memory chip

   It is possible to visualize a typical internal main memory structure
   as consisting of rows and columns of basic cells.  Each cell is
   capable of storing one bit of information.

2.  16-Byte Ordering

   Storing data often requires more than a byte.  For example, we need
   four bytes of memory to store an integer variable that can take a
   value between 0 and 2^32 - 1.  Suppose that we want to store these
   4-byte data in memory at locations 100 through 103.  How do we store
   them?
