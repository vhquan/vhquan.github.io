IP address is your house no. You can reach the house by just knowing the house
no, but there are 10 members within a house. Who should receive the parcel?
The receiver is identified by port. The person whose name is on the parcel
should receive the parcel. The idea behind using port no. is that since there
are so many applications running on your system, which application should
receive the packet? It is decide by port. So, IP address is the idenfier of
your system and port no is the identifier of application running on that
system
</p>

I like to think of networking in terms of real life. So if the computer is my
home, IP address is the street number, and MAC the house number. But that's
not all you need to enter my house, is it?
</p>

<p>
You need doors too, or maybe a window, to enter the house.
</p>

<p>
Thats what ports are.
</p>

<p>
Now generally a house has doors on one of the vertical walls. So you circle
around the house, find such a door and try to enter. These are the
well-defined ports, whose port numbers are fixed, and any basic port scan will
scan these ones.
</p>

<p>
But what if I have an underground door. Or maybe I have a door on the
horizontal wall (roof). These are the other port numbers.
</p>

<p>
So your machine will know the well defined port numbers, but if you want to
connect to a server, say foo, but food has moved its http server from port 80
to port 34251, then you will be unable to find it, as by default, your browser
will try co connect to port 80 and find it closed.

<h2 id="orgdd9c526"><span class="section-number-2">1.</span> What is a computer port?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
A port in computing has three main uses, each as a type of receptable in
networking, computer hardware and software:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>A port in networking is a software-defined number associated to a network
protocol that receives or transmits communication for a specific service.</li>

<li>A port in computer hardware is a jack or socket that peripheral hardware
plugs into.</li>

<li>A port in computer software is when a piece of software has been translated
or converted to run on different hardware or operating system (OS) that it
was originally designed for.</li>
</ol>

<div id="outline-container-org8b8cfe3" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org8b8cfe3"><span class="section-number-2">2.</span> What is a computer network port?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
A port in computer networking is how a computer can use a single physical
network connection to handle many incomming and outgoing requests by assigning
a port number to each. The numbers go from 0 to 65535, which is a 16-bit
number.
</p>

<p>
Some of these port numbers are specifically defined and always associated with
a specific type of service &#x2013; for example. File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is
always port number 21 and Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) web traffic is
always port 80. These are called <i>well-known ports</i> and go from 0 to 1023.
</p>

<p>
The numbers from 1024 to 49151 are called <i>registered ports</i> and can be
registered with the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority for a specific
use. The numbers 49152 to 65535 are unassigned, can be used by any type of
service and are called <i>dynamic ports, private ports</i> or <i>ephemeral ports</i>.
</p>

<p>
As an illustration, think of a port number as a telephone extension in a
business telephone system. The company telephone number is like the computer
Internet Protocol (IP) address or Uniform Resource Locator (URL). It connects
users with the correct company but does not define who want to talk in the
company. A telephone extension will connect them with the right person in an
organization, however, and the port will connect them to the right service on
a computer. Dialing extension 0 to speak to an operator is extremely common in
all phone systems and is like the well-known ports that always define specific
services.
</p>

<p>
A port is always associated with a protocol. Generally, this is with
Transmission Control Protocol or User Datagram Protocol for communication, but
Internet Control Message Protocol messages use specific ports as well. The
port is specified by having the URL or IP address followed by a colon then the
port number &#x2013; as examples, 10.0.0.1:80 or www.techtarget.com:443. With all
internet communication, there is always an associated port, but it may not be
shown to the user as it is often implied by the type of communication.
</p>

<p>
A computer can manage many simulatenous connections on a single inbound
port. This is because the local IP address, local port, remote IP address and
remote port specify each connection. A listening port is when the computer is
actively waiting for inbound requests on that port number , allowing those
connections. Port forwarding is when communication to one address on a
specific port is then sent, or forwarded, to another computer for processing.

<h2 id="org9599800"><span class="section-number-2">3.</span> How do network ports affect cybersecurity?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p>
Network ports are a major factor in network security and cybersecurity in
general.
</p>

<p>
Port scanning, for example, tries all ports at an address to see which ones
are open and listening. Attackers can use this to find vulnerable services
that they can then attack.
</p>

<p>
Firewalls take the port number into consideration when determining to allow or
block communication. They are configured to only allow communication to the
specific ports needed for a service and block other unneeded ports so they
cannot be exploited.
</p>

<p>
As an example, of ports in use, say a company wants to have a website, email
and secure file transfer service on the internet. Its firewall would allow
inbound connections to port 80 and 443 for web traffic, port 25 for inbound
email and port 22 for Secure Shell FTP (SFTP). It forwards these ports to the
specific servers for each type of service. The firewall will block all other
ports.
</p>

<p>
So, if an employee incorrectly tries to use FTP on port 21 instead of SFTP, it
will be blocked. Or, for instance, if an attacker tries to connect to port
3389 for Window Remote Desktop to gain control of a server, the firewall will
block the connection.

<h2 id="org5bd6d8f"><span class="section-number-2">4.</span> What is a computer hardware port?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">
<p>
In computer hardware, a port is the jack or receptable for some other
peripheral device to plug into. These are standardized for each purpose.
</p>

<p>
Some common ports are Universal Serial Bus ports, USB-C ports, Ethernet ports
or DisplayPorts. Some older ports no longer in common use are serial ports,
parallel ports and mouse/keyboard PS/2 ports. As a general guideline, if the
plug receptable is on a computer, it is called a <i>port</i>; if the receptable is on
a wall, it is called a <i>jack</i>.

<h2 id="org0bff3a3"><span class="section-number-2">5.</span> What is a computer software port?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-5">
<p>
In computer software, the verb <i>porting</i> is the process by which software is
changed or translated to run on different hardware types or OSes than it ws
originally programmed for. The result can be called a <i>port</i> of the Software.
</p>

<p>
Example of this include the following:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Microsoft originally programmed Windows 10 to run on x86 processors but is
now porting Windows to also run on Arm processors.</li>
<li>Microsoft programmed Office to run on Window OSes, but a port of Office is
also available for macOS.</li>
<li>Porting games originally designed to run on one video game console to run on
another type of console is also common.</li>
