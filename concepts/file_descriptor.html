A file descriptor is an unsigned integer used by a process to identify an open
file.
</p>

<p>
The number of file descriptors available to a process is limited by the
<code>/OPEN_MAX</code> control in the <code>sys/limits.h</code> file. The number of file descriptors is
also controlled by the <code>ulimit -n</code> flag. The <i>open, pipe, creat,</i> and <i>fcntl</i>
subroutines all generate file descriptors. File descriptors are generally
unique to each process, but they can be shared by child processes created with
a <b>fork</b> subroutine or copied by the <i>fcntl, dup,</i> and <i>dup2</i> subroutines.
</p>

<p>
File descriptors are indexes to the file descriptor table in the <i>u<sub>block</sub></i> area
maintained by the kernel for each process. The most common ways for processes
to obtain file descriptors are through <i>open</i> and <i>creat</i> operations or through
inheritance from a parent process. When a <i>fork</i> operation occurs, the
descriptor table is copied for the child process, which allows the child
process equal access to the files used by the parent process.

According to what I have read, processes get a fd that indexes into user fd
table that in turn returns a pointer into file table that maintains offset,
pointer to inode and other properties of the opened file. So fd is basically
maintaining a way to access file on disk, its position in the file. So can't
commands like open directly return pointer into file table rather than going
through the indirection of user fd table? Is it there for security or for some
other reason, or have I understood this wrong?
<img src="../images/fd.png" alt="fd.png" />
</p>

<p>
-&gt; Isn't fd table allocated for every new process and file table the global
   table in the kernel?
</p>

<p>
-&gt; That's it. A table in the kernel is necessary to be able to track every
   open file in the system and manage all of this correctly, and at least some
   information is needed in the user space of the process.
</p>

<p>
-&gt; User space needs to know the file table entries for the files it has opened
   so you don't system calls directly give a pointer to that instead of going
   through user fd table.
</p>

<p>
-&gt; Because you can't have a user space pointer pointing to something in the
kernel.
</p>

<p>
-&gt; If the program is in user mode the kernel won't allow access to the kernel
   memory, however if uintptr a = open(&#x2026;); read(a, buffer, sizeof(buffer))
   the program would go into kernel mode for system calls which will allow the
   access to kernel memory, so wldnt having a pointer simplify one step for
   the kernel.
</p>

<p>
-&gt; Why would it simplify? An int or a pointer would necessitate the same
   operations. But using a pointer would mean that the kernel is mapped into
   the address space of the process, which is probably a too strong constraint
   on implementation.

<li>What would be a more simplified description of file descriptors compared to
Wikipedia's? Why are they required? Say, take shell processes as an example
and how does it apply for it?</li>

<li>Does a process table contain more than one file descriptor. If yes, why?</li>

<li>What about the concepts of stdin stdout stderr etc? I have an instance like
say broswer process opened and it has opened some temporary files for
displayed my html. The process uses the same fd to read/write? Also the
process table &#x2026; it has entries like fd1 pointer fd1 pointer &#x2026; does that
mean all these files are in RAM? Why else pointers?</li>

<p>
When you open a file, OS creates a stream to that file and connect that stream
to opened file, the descriptor in fact represents that stream. Similarly there
are some default streams created by OS. These streams are connected to your
terminal instead of files. So when you write something in terminal it goes to
stdin stream and OS. And when you write "ls" command on terminal, the OS
writes the output to stdout stream. stdout stream is connected to your monitor
terminal so you can see the output there.
</p>
<hr />
<p>
In simple words, when you open a file, the operating system creates an entry
to represent that file and store the information about that opened file. So if
there are 100 files opened in your OS then there will be 100 entries in OS
(somewhere in kernel). These entries are represented by integers like (&#x2026;100,
101, 102, &#x2026;). This entry number is the file descriptor. So it is just an
integer number that uniquely represents an opened file for the process. If
your process open 10 files then your process table will have 10 entries for
file descriptors.
</p>

<p>
Similarly, when you open a network socket, it is also represented by an
integer and it is called Socket Descriptor.
