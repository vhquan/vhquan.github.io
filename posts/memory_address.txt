* MEMORY ADDRESSING

THe memory of a computer system consists of tiny electronic switches, with
each switch in one of two states: open or closed. It is, however, more
convenient to think of these states as 0 and 1, rather than open and closed.
Thus, each switch can represent a bit. The memory unit consists of millions of
such bits. In order to make memory more manageable, eight bits are grouped
into a byte. Memory can then be viewed as consisting of an ordered sequence of
bytes.
