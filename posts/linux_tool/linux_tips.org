1. Disable touchpad on linux using the command line
You could also use/install xinput.
Run the command =xinput=, it will give you a list of input devices, find your
touchpad in the list and it's number (id) = NUMOFDEV.

#+begin_src bash
xinput set-prop NUMOFDEV "Device Enabled" 0
#+end_src

That should disable it.

2. Makefile command substitution
My Makefile
#+begin_src makefile
all: ... (other rules) clean

clean:
    rm $(find . -type f -executable)
#+end_src
When I delete =clean= rule from the above Makefile everything works as
expected. After adding, =make= (also =make clean=) command results in:
#+begin_src bash
rm
rm: missing operand
Try 'rm --help' for more information
make: *** [Makefile: 46: clean] Error 1
#+end_src
What causes problem here and how can I solve?

*Answer*:
There are several issues.

*Passing a $ sign in a Makefile to the shell*
You want to run the command
#+begin_src bash
rm $(find . -type f -executable)
#+end_src
to let the shell do the command substitution. To do this you need to write
#+begin_src makefile
clean:
    rm $$(find . -type f -executable)
#+end_src
with the dollar doubled as Make itself us =$=.
