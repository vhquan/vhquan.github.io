1. Disable touchpad on linux using the command line
You could also use/install xinput.
Run the command =xinput=, it will give you a list of input devices, find your
touchpad in the list and it's number (id) = NUMOFDEV.

#+begin_src bash
xinput set-prop NUMOFDEV "Device Enabled" 0
#+end_src

That should disable it.
